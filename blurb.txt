Using computers as more than glorified typewriters or calculators is an increasingly important aspect of any scientific or technological field, and knowing how to program a computer to solve new problems is becoming as essential a skill as mathematics. Learning how to program can be a frustrating experience at time, since computers require a level of preciseness and rigor in how we must express that we never encounter elsewhere in life. Further, computers will do *exactly* what you ask them to do, regardless of your actual intend, even if this can have catastrophic consequences. On the other hand, learning how to program can also be very rewarding. Programs are created out of pure thought, and it is a special feeling to seeing a computer translate your thoughts into actions and see it solve your problems for you. To get to that point, however, you must learn to think about computations in a new wayâ€”you must learn computational thinking.
