# Introduction

This book gives an introduction to embedded domain specific languages in R. The term *domain specific languages* refers to programming languages specialised for a given purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages. Domain specific languages ideally give you a precise way of specifying computations you want to do within a specialised context. Regular expressions is an example, where you have a specialised language to express patterns of text; you can use this domain specific language to define text strings to search for or use it to modify text based on patterns. Another example is SQL, a language specialised for extracting from and modifying in a relational data base.
