# Introduction

This book gives an introduction to embedded domain specific languages in R. The term *domain specific languages,* or DSL, refers to programming languages specialised for a given purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages. Domain specific languages ideally give you a precise way of specifying computations you want to do within a specialised context. Regular expressions is an example, where you have a specialised language to express patterns of text; you can use this domain specific language to define text strings to search for or use it to modify text based on patterns. Another example is SQL, a language specialised for extracting from and modifying in a relational data base. The *embedded* part refers to the DSL being expressed in the syntax of another language. Regular expressions and SQL are usually expressed as strings that must be compiled or interpreted when invoked. The grammar of graphics implemented in `ggplot2` or the data transformation operations implemented in `dplyr` provide small languages, domain specific languages, that you can use from within R, and you write the programs for these languages in R as well. Embedded DSLs provide flexible ways of expressing some intend, a data transformation pipeline for example, but use the surrounding language to express this intend in. We consider them languages because of their flexibility---they usually
